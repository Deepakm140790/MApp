I have considered below 2 state for developing the app.

A. A sample app for training
You are the leader of a five-person Android team. An inexperienced Android engineer has joined your team.
To train this engineer, you decide to implement a sample app as simply structured as possible to use as an example.

B. A base for an app that will be developed and maintained for a long time
You are the leader of a five-person Android team. This team will be developing a new Android app and the project is 
expected to be developed and maintained by the team for a long time. As the leader, you will be designing the app and 
implementing the basics before the rest of the team begins work on it. Your output will be used as the base upon which 
more features will be added in the future.
